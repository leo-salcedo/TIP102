# Given a friendâ€™s liked restaurants and a list of other customers' likes:
# 1. Identify customers who share at least 2 restaurants with the friend.
# 2. From those customers, count how often they like restaurants the friend hasnâ€™t liked.
# 3.Recommend the restaurant with the highest count. If tied, return any. If none, return None.


# friend_likes_1_1 = [1, 4, 10]
# likes_data_1 = [
# [10, 7, 1, 8, 6]    # Two restaurants are in common (1, 10)    Count the other restaurants (7, 8, 6) once.
#    [8, 3, 7, 2, 1]     # Only restaurant 1 is in common.          Don't count any of these.
#    [6, 7, 10, 4, 5]    # Two restaurants in common.               Count (6, 7, 5) once.
